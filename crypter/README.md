## Simple ELF Crypter for 590J

This project is a very simple ELF64 crypter that uses RC4 encryption. Given an ELF64 file, it will encrypt it with RC4, and build a small ELF64 file around that with a stub to decrypt it and execute it in memory. To execute in memory without touching the disk, this project uses the `memfd_create` and `execveat` syscalls.

Currently, this project uses a static encryption/decryption key of 0x1234567812345678. This will be changed to a dynamically generated key before the final submission. Additionally, it creates a static (no relocation) ELF64; this might be improved to support relocation if more complicated decryptor stubs are required. 

I've also included a simple "hello_world" ELF64 file that I've been using to test.

### Usage
To build this project, just run the provided Makefile with `make`.

To crypt an executable, run `./crypter param1 param2` where param1 is the executable to encrypt, and param2 is the output file to write to. Make sure that this is run in the same directory as `stub.bin`, which is generated by the Makefile
